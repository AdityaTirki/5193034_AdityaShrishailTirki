/*
When allocating memory for a string pointer, you may want to use string length rather than the sizeof operator for calculating bytes. 
Consider the following program:
This approach is better memory management because you arenâ€™t allocating more space than is needed to a pointer. When using strlen to determine the number of bytes needed for a string, be sure to include one extra byte for the NULL character '\0'.

A char is always one byte, so there is no need to multiply the memory requirements by sizeof(char).
